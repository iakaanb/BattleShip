## Description
 In this classic game of strategy and deduction, you'll 
  go head-to-head with your opponent, taking turns to place your 
  ships strategically on the grid and launch attacks to sink their fleet.
  Terminal Battleship is an interactive command-line implementation of the 
  classic game Battleship, developed using OCaml and its utop interface. 

  The project aims to provide an engaging and immersive gaming 
  experience entirely within the terminal environment. The game follows the 
  traditional rules of Battleship, where two players take turns placing their 
  ships on a grid and attempting to sink each other's fleet by guessing the 
  coordinates of the opponent's ships. The project incorporates a user-friendly 
  interface that allows players to input their moves and receive visual feedback
  on the outcome of their attacks.
